Insight about the project: 
Implementing an identity recognition system based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and evaluating it with the provided dataset taken from BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB) that consists of 200 subjects includes four eye images (two left and two right) for people within the age range of 18-73. Using a high-level language program, particularly Python, and common libraries such as PyTorch OpenCV, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.

I also provided the dataset that I used in this project so that you can try it by yourself. 

Enjoy it. 

All rights saved, if you want to use any piece of the code, mentioning my name will be enough.
